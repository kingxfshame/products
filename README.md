## I was required
1.	Implement API calls for creating, updating and deleting these records. 

2.	Implement API calls for retrieving a list of products, and for searching a product by name. 

3.	Ensure that the API calls have proper error handling, and output sensible error messages. 

4.	Document the API: explain the proper way to use it. Assume that the reader is not familiar with the API, and will be using it as a service (having no access to the source code). 

# Documentation
* All scripts for adding - removing - editing products are in the file php / function.php
* The script for finding products is at the beginning of the index.php file.

* Search works, as well as by product name and by description.


# Database
### I have only 5 fields in the database.
* id
* name
* description
* image
* price 
### I also attached the database with the products.sql file.
